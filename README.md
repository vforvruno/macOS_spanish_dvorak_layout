# osx_spanish_dvorak_layout

My custom spanish dvorak layout for OSX
Found it here: https://adrianperales.com/2019/10/como-configurar-el-teclado-dvorak-espanol-en-macos/ but I needed a couple of modifications for coding.

## How to Install

Download the repo and move the file to `/Library/Keyboard\ Layout/`
