# macOS Spanish Dvorak Layout

My custom Spanish Dvorak layout for macOS

Found the original one [here](https://adrianperales.com/2019/10/como-configurar-el-teclado-dvorak-espanol-en-macos/) but I needed a couple of modifications for coding.

## How to Install

Download the repo and move the file to `/Library/Keyboard\ Layout/`

## How to change the bindings

Open the bundle file with [Ukelele](https://software.sil.org/ukelele/) and set the keyboard type("View"->"Keyboard type") to "Aluminium Wireless" for Macbooks

## My custom modifications:
- Switched `~` and `¢` so I can __Option + 4__ for `~`
- Added `\` instead of `≤` to __Option + the button left to number 1__
